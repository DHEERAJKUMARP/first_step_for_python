# 🔐 String Manipulation by Building a Cipher

This project is part of the [Scientific Computing with Python](../README.md) course on freeCodeCamp.

## 📜 Description

This Python project demonstrates the use of string manipulation and loops to implement a **Vigenère Cipher**, which can both encrypt and decrypt text using a keyword.

## 🧠 Key Concepts

- String indexing and slicing
- Conditional logic (`if`/`else`)
- For loops
- Custom functions
- Cipher logic with key rotation

## 🛠 Files

- `cipher.py`: Main Python script with encryption/decryption logic.

## 🧪 Usage

```bash
python cipher.py

Encrypted text: mrttaqrhknsw ih puggrur
Key: happycoding
Decrypted text: secretsyntax is awesome
