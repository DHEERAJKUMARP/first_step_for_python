# ðŸ’° Expense Tracker Using Lambda Functions

This project demonstrates how to use **lambda functions** and **basic list operations** in Python by building a simple command-line expense tracker.

---

## ðŸ“œ Description

The tracker allows users to:
- Add expenses (amount + category)
- List all expenses
- Calculate total expenses using `sum()` and `lambda`
- Filter expenses by category using `filter()` and a lambda expression

## ðŸ“„ Files
