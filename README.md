# 🐍 First Step for Python

Welcome to my learning journey in Python!  
This repository contains beginner to intermediate projects I'm building as I complete the **Scientific Computing with Python** certification on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/).

## 📘 Scientific Computing with Python Projects

These are mini-projects I've built while learning key programming concepts like strings, loops, and logic building:

| Project Name | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| [🔐 String Manipulation by Building a Cipher](./Scientific%20Computing%20with%20Python/String%20Manipulation%20by%20Building%20a%20Cipher/README.md) | Vigenère cipher to encrypt and decrypt messages using custom keys. |
| [💳 Luhn Algorithm Card Validator](./Scientific%20Computing%20with%20Python/Luhn%20Algorithm%20Card%20Validator/README.md) | Validates credit card numbers using the Luhn algorithm. |
| [💰 Expense Tracker Using Lambda Functions](./Scientific%20Computing%20with%20Python/Expense%20Tracker%20Using%20Lambda%20Functions/README.md) | A simple CLI expense tracker using `lambda`, `filter`, and `map`. |
